**Work In Progress**  

# Background  
This project was executed for two reasons:
1. I started working in a new laboratory at the University of Arizona that recently opened and we have started recruiting students. These students and future laboratory members will need access to basic information about us and access to resources we approve of for research projects and analysis.  
2. I was selected to participate in the 2020 cohort of the <b><a href="https://cyverse-foss-2020.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">CyVerse Learning Institute - Foundations of Open Science Skills (FOSS)</a></b. This is a week long workshop that prepares principal investigators and their lab teams, both new and established, to meet the growing expectations of funding agencies, publishers, and research institutions for scientific reproducibility and data accessibility. As part of our participation in this workshop the cohort was tasked with developing and executing a project that utilized skills we learned over the week.
