## Resources

Descriptions and links to our preferred resources:

**[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)**  
bioRxiv (pronounced "bio-archive") is a free online archive and distribution service for unpublished preprints in the life sciences. It is operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a not-for-profit research and educational institution. By posting preprints on bioRxiv, authors are able to make their findings immediately available to the scientific community and receive feedback on draft manuscripts before they are submitted to journals.  

**[ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)**  
ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.  

**[HaploReg](https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php)**  
HaploReg is a tool for exploring annotations of the noncoding genome at variants on haplotype blocks, such as candidate regulatory SNPs at disease-associated loci. Using LD information from the 1000 Genomes Project, linked SNPs and small indels can be visualized along with chromatin state and protein binding annotation from the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects, sequence conservation across mammals, the effect of SNPs on regulatory motifs, and the effect of SNPs on expression from eQTL studies. HaploReg is designed for researchers developing mechanistic hypotheses of the impact of non-coding variants on clinical phenotypes and normal variation.  

**[Inxight](https://drugs.ncats.io/)**  
The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has developed Inxight: Drugs as a comprehensive portal for drug development information. NCATS Inxight: Drugs contains information on ingredients in medicinal products, including:
- US APPROVED DRUGS: 2,351
- MARKETED DRUGS: 6,041
- INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS: 7,099
- ALL SUBSTANCES: 107,353  

NCATS Inxight: Drugs incorporates and unifies a wealth of data, including manually curated data supplied by the FDA and private companies, and provides marketing and regulatory status, rigorous drug ingredient definitions, biological activity, clinical use, and more.  

**[LocusZoom](http://locuszoom.org/)**  
LocusZoom is a suite of tools to provide fast visualization of GWAS results for research and publication.  

**[Oxford BIG](http://big.stats.ox.ac.uk/)**  
The primary aim of the browser is to support interpretation of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results for Brain Imaging phenotypes and possible links to GWAS of other non-brain imaging phenotypes. The browser is built on top of data from several sources.  

**[Pharos](https://pharos.ncats.nih.gov/)**  
Pharos is the user interface to the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund. (Grant No. 1U24CA224370-01). The goal of KMC is to develop a comprehensive, integrated knowledge-base for the Druggable Genome (DG) to illuminate the uncharacterized and/or poorly annotated portion of the DG, focusing on three of the most commonly drug-targeted protein families:
- G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
- ion channels (ICs)
- kinases  

The Pharos interface provides facile access to all data types collected by the KMC. Given the complexity of the data surrounding any target, efficient and intuitive visualization has been a high priority, to enable users to quickly navigate & summarize search results and rapidly identify patterns. A critical feature of the interface is the ability to perform flexible search and subsequent drill down of search results. Underlying the interface is a RESTful API that provides programmatic access to all KMC data, allowing for easy consumption in user applications.
