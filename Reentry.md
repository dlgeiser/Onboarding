## Return to Research Protocol  

COVID-19 related guidance and resources for working in the SanGiovanni Laboratory:  

All research personnel should be properly trained in research procedures and safe equipment use. Researchers should remain flexible to changing circumstances and remain postured and prepared to safely/securely ramp down operations in the future, as necessary. Please consult <b><a href="https://research.arizona.edu/covid19/research-restart" target="_blank">Research, Innovation and Impact (RII)</a></b> for any questions/concerns.  

The purpose of this protocol, which should be reviewed prior to entering the laboratory, is to:
1) Ensure all researchers evaluate and plan for the health and safety of researchers, participants, and potentially impacted communities prior to resuming research or commencing new research;
2) Assist researchers to review their critical operations, plans, approvals, and equipment before resuming or commencing new operations following the UArizona temporary closure.
  
<b>For in-person, face-to-face interaction:</b>  
All involved are consistently able to (or anticipated to be able to) follow and maintain physical distancing, according to <b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" target="_blank">CDC guidelines</a></b> throughout any inperson
interactions.  

Research staff will utilize the <b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html" target="_blank">hierarchy of controls</a></b> to ensure physical distancing is maintained or mitigated by additional control measures.  

<b>For Human Subjects projects:</b>  
The level of our projects with Human Subjects falls within the "None/Low/Medium" categories as outlined in the IRB's <b><a href="https://uarizona.co1.qualtrics.com/CP/File.php?F=F_9yKtXGMfePzV833" target="_blank">"Resuming human studies"</a></b> document where proper conditions/mitigation efforts will be achieved and maintained.

<b>For use of face coverings:</b>  
Employees, students, and visitors must use <b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target="_blank">face coverings</a></b> as follows:  
* Indoor – You are required to wear a face covering in all UArizona buildings (including hallways, public spaces, restrooms, and common areas), with the exception of those private offices, work spaces, and formal meeting areas where physical distancing of at least six feet is possible.  
* Outdoor – You are required to wear a face covering while in UArizona outdoor spaces except where physical distancing of at least six feet is possible.  

<b>For cleaning and disinfection:</b>  
Researchers will follow established <b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html" target="_blank">cleaning and disinfection</a></b> routines for all research spaces and environments.
