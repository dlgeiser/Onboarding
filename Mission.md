The aims of our efforts are to elucidate the science of nutrient-responsive sensing and signaling processes in human systems and to rationally apply this knowledge in development of effective interventions. We apply three approaches in these endeavors; namely:  
1. Integrative omics to:  
   a) characterize and catalog structural chemistry and molecular dynamics of nutrient-responsive human systems (receptors, transporters, enzymes and hormones)  
   b) determine functional implications of structural variation in elements of these systems  
2. Physiological optics to characterize in vivo human response to nutrient intake (tissue status change and retinal/visual function)  
3. Ultra-structural/membrane/organoid biophysics to identify modifiable ('druggable') mechanisms and rate-limiting steps of nutrient sensing and signaling in human retina and brain
